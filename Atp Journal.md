Welcome to my weekly Journal for engineering realisation
> ### Week 1
Creating the Weekly Journal
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To create the journal I used a text editor with a Markdown preview , ATOM
<p>&nbsp;</p>

> ### Week 2
Assembly of Actual vehicle chassis and Markdown


> ### Week 3
Designing 3D model

To start the design of the vehicle , I have started to replicate the chassis in Autodesk Inventor 2016

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The main challenges of this were mostly caused by getting inaccurate measurements of the assembled Chassis for the model

> ### Week 4
Assembly of 3d Model and discussion

With the 3D model done , it was time to make a completed assembly where we could design our vehicle on

<p>&nbsp;</p>
