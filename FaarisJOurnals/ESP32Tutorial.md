# ESP32 Tutorial
How to install python on your ESP32 ?
Before we start make sure that you have the latest version of python installed on your computer.Here is a [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install 
### Step 1
Download the Latest MicroPython Firmware
In this [link](https://micropython.org/download/#esp32), search for "esp32-idf3-20191109-v1.11-571-g7e374d231.bin", click and then download
### Step 2
Launch your command prompt on windows and enter the following 
```sh
pip install --upgrade esptool
```

### Step 3
Next enter the following in the command prompt and it shoudl look like this
```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32 -p <USB-to-Serial Port> erase_flash
```
Before flashing the firmware to the ESP32, we'll want to erase everything in the chip's flash memory. To that, enter the following command (replace <USB-to-Serial Port> with your particular port name, such as COM7 on Windows, /dev/tty.usbserial-<letters and numbers> on macOS, or /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux):

### Step 4
Next enter the following in the command prompt and it should look like this
```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32 -p <USB-to-Serial Port> write_flash -z 0x1000 <path to .bin>
```
Next, flash the firmware with the following command (replace <USB-to-Serial Port> with your particular port name, and replace <path to .bin> with the location of your downloaded firmware file, such as ~/Downloads/esp32-20180822-v1.9.4-479-g828f771e3.bin):

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](http://breakdance.io) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)
