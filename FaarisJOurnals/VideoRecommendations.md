# One video I recommend for python programming
### "Python Programming"
### https://youtu.be/N4mEzFDjqtA
I find this video one of the best because it goes through the basics of python structures, from variables to dictionaries to shortcuts. This video explains all the necessary codes you need to start writing the program, and its only 43 mins long. It is a quick way to start things up.
However, in the context of Engineering Academy where we will mostly be playing with microcontrollers, we need to learn how to interact with the microcontroller, such like input and output functions. This, however, is lacking in the video. That is why i would recommmend watching  [Invent Box Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQCzMftIUElX03kHjV4rmQ/featured) that shows basic codes such as to make the led blink on an ESP32.  


# Two videos i recommend on Thonny IDE
### "Thonny - a Python IDE for beginners"
### https://youtu.be/lWaCl0WjNZI
The reason i liked this video a lot because it taught me the useful features thonny had, with examples given by the youtuber. One such example is that thonny have this amazing feature called "debug current script", which shows the user the steps taken by the computer when running the codes.I cant explain this feature that well, so you will need to refer to the video.This feature is especially useful because it can help users find out exactly where their errors are at, and why is it so in the shoes of the computer.This video swiftly guides users all the important features, and that is why I was able to learn a lot.
Another video would be https://youtu.be/nwIgxrXP-X4. It is a shorter and even simplified version of the functions and features of thonny ide. This video is simple to understand as examples are demonstrated by the youtuber. If you are looking to have a quick run through with less explanation then this is the right video for you.
