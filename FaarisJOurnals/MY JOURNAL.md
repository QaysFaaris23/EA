# MY COMMITMENTS TO THE SCDF TRACKED VEHICLE

### About vehicle
Basically as the head mechanical designer i am tasked to do everything about the chassis and moving parts. To begin, i first designed the main platform to mount the turret and the engine compartment.I split this platform into two, engine platform to hold the "engine compartment" which houses the electronics and turret platform to hold the turret. I ensures that they are in seperate compartments so that any water leakage from the nozzle on the turret wont spill into the electronics compartment. See the photo below

I used a partial V shaped slider to secure both platforms into one rigid object, and secured them to the chassis of the tank with M10 screw and nut

Next i move on the "engine compartment". I designed rather large compartment to easily store the electronics component, which is easily accesible with a sliding lid on top. See the photos below

Much like the engine platform, i also used a V shaped slider to secure my engine compartment and the platform, and with an additional 5.8 diameter bolt and nut to further secure it to ensure its rigidity

As for the lid its tight fit

Next ill shall move on to the turret. A servo rest inside the turret platform, and the turret ring is secured to the servo with a screw which holds the turret ring between the head of the screw and the servo. Do note theres a thread inside the servo head which can be screwed into

Next the z axis servo holder is placed into one of the turret ring's pin slot. I added a small out facing pillar so that the servo holder does not fall right through the pin slot

Next i we insert the servo, followed by the modular mount and screw to secure them together

The modular mount has two V shaped slider to mount multiples types of accessories.That would be the fpv camera or the nozzle for the water spray. If there are any other mods we want to put we just need to design a V shaped mount on it. See the photos

Notice the V shape slider

Having my own 3D printer at home, i needed to check for the dimensional tolerances of my prints.Therefore i printed sectioned parts of the actual print for testing. I found out that my printer would need an offset of 0.2mm for a nice fitting between a pair of sliders.Here are some of the test prints
