Welcome to my weekly Journal for engineering realisation
> ### Week 1


> ### Week 2
Assembly of Actual vehicle chassis and Markdown

> ### Week 3
Designing 3D model
To start the design of the vehicle , I have started to replicate the chassis in Autodesk Inventor 2016
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The main challenges of this were mostly caused by getting inaccurate measurements of the assembled Chassis for the model

Assembly of 3d Model and discussion

With the 3D model done , it was time to make a completed assembly where we could design our vehicle on
